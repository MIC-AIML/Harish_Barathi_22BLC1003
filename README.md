Harmful vs Harmless Image Classifier

I have used a deep learning technique called transfer learning to build the neural network and have used my own CNN model to compare the accuracy between both

Transfer learning is a technique used in deep learning where a pre-trained model, which was trained on a large dataset, is used as a starting point for a new task.This model can be trained according to our dataset and proves to give highly accurate predictions.
